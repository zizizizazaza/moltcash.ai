# test: V1 vs V2 Comparison Test Plan

## Overview

Run the same queries through both the public v1 and private v2 of last30days, compare output quality across 7 dimensions, and determine if v2 is ready to ship as the new public version.

**This plan also includes a full feature audit** identifying everything v1 has that v2 is missing — some of those gaps need fixing before shipping.

---

## How to Run the Comparison

### Setup

**V1 (public upstream):** Check out upstream SKILL.md temporarily:
```bash
# Save current v2
cp ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md.v2

# Install v1 from upstream
cd /Users/mvanhorn/last30days-skill-private
git show upstream/main:SKILL.md > ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md
```

Run test queries in a NEW Claude Code session (one session per query to avoid context bleed). Save output.

**V2 (private current):** Restore v2:
```bash
cp ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md.v2 ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md
```

Run same queries in NEW sessions. Save output.

## FEATURE AUDIT: V1 vs V2

### Section-by-section comparison

I diffed the full v1 (upstream/main) SKILL.md against the current v2. Here's everything.

#### KEPT (in both versions) ✅

| Feature | V1 Location | V2 Location | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Parse User Intent section | Lines 23-48 | Lines 12-38 | Same logic |

#### ❌ MISSING FROM V2 — Features V1 Has That V2 Dropped

These are the regressions. Some are intentional simplifications, others are real gaps.

**1. Use Cases Block (intro section)**
- **V1 has:** 4 use case examples right after the intro: Prompting, Recommendations, News, General — with concrete examples
- **V2 has:** Nothing. Just the intro paragraph.
- **Impact:** LOW. The query type detection handles this. But it was nice onboarding.
- **Verdict:** Skip — not needed for execution quality.

**2. Setup Check Section (API key guidance)**
- **V1 has:** Full section explaining 3 modes (Full/Partial/Web-Only), first-time setup bash script, "API keys are OPTIONAL" messaging
- **V2 has:** Nothing. Script auto-detects.
- **Impact:** LOW for experienced users. HIGH for first-time users who don't have keys.
- **Verdict:** Skip for now — script handles auto-detection. Consider adding back for public release.

**3. Anti-Pattern Examples (synthesis quality guard)**
- **V1 has:** Explicit anti-pattern block: "If user asks about 'clawdbot skills' and research returns ClawdBot content (self-hosted AI agent), do NOT synthesize this as 'Claude Code skills' just because both involve 'skills'." Plus BAD/GOOD synthesis examples for RECOMMENDATIONS.
- **V2 has:** Only "Ground your synthesis in the ACTUAL research content, not your pre-existing knowledge" — no concrete examples.
- **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Without concrete anti-patterns, the agent may conflate similar-sounding things.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. At minimum, restore the BAD/GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS example and the "don't conflate" warning.

**4. Self-Check Instruction (pre-display validation)**
- **V1 has:** "SELF-CHECK before displaying: Re-read your 'What I learned' section. Does it match what the research ACTUALLY says? If the research was about ClawdBot (a self-hosted AI agent), your summary should be about ClawdBot, not Claude Code. If you catch yourself projecting your own knowledge instead of the research, rewrite it."
- **V2 has:** Nothing.
- **Impact:** MEDIUM. The self-check forces the model to validate its own output.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. One line costs nothing and catches hallucination.

**5. Quality Checklist for Prompts ⭐**
- **V1 has:** Explicit checklist before delivering a prompt:
  ```
  ### Quality Checklist:
  - [ ] FORMAT MATCHES RESEARCH - If research said JSON/structured/etc, prompt IS that format
  - [ ] Directly addresses what the user said they want to create
  - [ ] Uses specific patterns/keywords discovered in research
  - [ ] Ready to paste with zero edits (or minimal [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked)
  - [ ] Appropriate length and style for TARGET_TOOL
  ```
- **V2 has:** Only "If research says to use a specific prompt FORMAT, YOU MUST USE THAT FORMAT." — one line instead of 5 checks.
- **Impact:** HIGH. This is likely what the user noticed as missing — v1 prompts felt more polished because the agent ran a checklist before delivering.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. This is the "that's a great prompt" quality feel.

**6. Prompt Format Anti-Pattern**
- **V1 has:** "ANTI-PATTERN: Research says 'use JSON prompts with device specs' but you write plain prose. This defeats the entire purpose of the research."
- **V2 has:** Only the positive instruction (use the format research recommends).
- **Impact:** MEDIUM. Negative examples ("don't do this") are powerful for LLMs.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. One line.

**7. "IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS" Section**
- **V1 has:** "Only if they ask for alternatives or more prompts, provide 2-3 variations. Don't dump a prompt pack unless requested."
- **V2 has:** Nothing about handling multi-prompt requests.
- **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM. Without it, agent might dump multiple prompts unprompted.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. Two lines.

**8. Web-Only Mode Stats Template + Promo**
- **V1 has:** Separate stats template for web-only mode with "💡 Want engagement metrics? Add API keys..." promo
- **V2 has:** Only the full-mode template. If running web-only, agent has no guidance.
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for users without API keys.
- **Verdict:** Consider adding back for public release. Lower priority for now.

**9. TARGET_TOOL Question Template**
- **V1 has:** Explicit AskUserQuestion block with 4 options: [Most relevant tool], Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT/Claude, Other
- **V2 has:** "run research first, then ask AFTER showing results" — but no actual question template.
- **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM. Agent will still ask, just less structured.
- **Verdict:** Skip — not critical.

**10. Context Memory: "Don't re-search" Instructions**
- **V1 has:** Explicit "DO NOT run new WebSearches — you already have the research. Answer from what you learned. Cite the Reddit threads, X posts, and web sources."
- **V2 has:** Only "Only do new research if the user explicitly asks about a DIFFERENT topic."
- **Impact:** MEDIUM. Without the explicit ban, agent may re-search on follow-ups, wasting time.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. Three lines.

**11. Output Summary Footer (emoji + engagement counts)**
- **V1 has:** `📚 Expert in: {TOPIC} for {TARGET_TOOL}` and `📊 Based on: {n} Reddit threads ({sum} upvotes) + {n} X posts ({sum} likes) + {n} web pages`
- **V2 has:** `Expert in: {TOPIC} for {TARGET_TOOL}` and `Based on: {n} Reddit threads + {n} X posts + {n} web pages` — no emoji, no engagement counts.
- **Impact:** LOW but noticeable. The emoji + counts make the footer feel more substantial.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ ADD BACK. Trivial fix.

## Priority Fix List (Before Shipping V2 as Public)

Based on the audit, these should be restored in V2 before it replaces V1:

### Must Fix (affects output quality)

| # | Missing Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|----------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Quality Checklist for prompts** | The "that's a great prompt" feel. V1's 5-point checklist made prompts more polished. | Add 8 lines to SKILL.md |
| 2 | **Anti-pattern examples** | BAD/GOOD synthesis examples prevent agent from conflating research. | Add 5 lines |
| 3 | **Self-check instruction** | One-line pre-display validation catches hallucination. | Add 2 lines |
| 4 | **Context Memory: don't re-search** | Prevents wasting time re-searching on follow-ups. | Add 3 lines |

### Should Fix (polish)

| # | Missing Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|----------------|-----|--------|
| 5 | **Prompt format anti-pattern** | Negative example reinforces "match the format". | Add 2 lines |
| 6 | **"IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS"** | Prevents prompt dumping. | Add 2 lines |
| 7 | **Output footer emoji + engagement counts** | More polished footer. | Edit 3 lines |

### Skip for Now (nice-to-have for public release)

| # | Missing Feature | Why Skip |
|---|----------------|----------|
| 8 | Use cases block (intro) | Doesn't affect execution |
| 9 | Setup Check section | Script auto-detects; add back for public README |
| 10 | Web-only mode stats + promo | Lower priority, most users have keys |
| 11 | TARGET_TOOL question template | Agent handles this naturally |

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Fix the gaps first
Apply the 7 "Must Fix" + "Should Fix" items from the audit to V2 SKILL.md. This takes ~20 minutes since it's all small text additions.

### Phase 2: Smoke test (4 queries)
Run queries #14 (kanye west), #2 (best clawdbot use cases), #8 (photorealistic nano banana pro), #10 (DeepSeek R1) on V2 only. Verify the fixes work.

### Phase 3: Full comparison (all 17 queries)
Run all 17 queries on both V1 and V2. Fill scorecards.

### Phase 4: Follow-up vision tests (4 queries)
Run the 4 follow-up vision tests. Compare prompt quality — this is where the quality checklist fix matters most.

### Phase 5: Analysis
- Sum scores per version across all queries
- Identify any dimension where v1 consistently beats v2
- Decision: ship v2, or fix more gaps first

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Feature audit complete (this document)
- [x] Must-fix gaps restored in V2 SKILL.md
- [ ] All 17 queries run on V2
- [ ] At least 4 queries run on V1 for comparison
- [ ] 4 follow-up vision tests completed
- [ ] Scorecards filled for each
- [ ] Total score comparison documented
- [ ] Any V1 > V2 regressions identified with fix plan
- [ ] Go/no-go decision on shipping v2 as public
